ASynK allows two-way sync of Contacts across any two support sources - Google
Contacts, Microsoft Outlook, and Emacs BBDB.

@item
ASynK is the only two-way synchronization option for BBDB known to be in
existence today. So if you are keen to keep your BBDB content synchronized
with a mobile device or Outlook, look no further.

@item
ASynK works on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux. Outlook synchronization
only works on Windows.

@item
Synchronization is granular to the level of 'Folders', i.e. you can
synchronize one folder of Google Contacts with a Outlook folder (on Windows at
work, say), and another Google folder in the same account with BBDB (On your
Mac, say)

@item
The infrastructure is there to add more database and item types (i.e. tasks,
notes, etc.), but currently only Contacts synchronization for Google Contacts,
BBDB and Outlook supported

@item
It is free software, and released under the GNU AGPL (Affero GPL)
version 3
