This is only a short introduction and some key points of interest. For more
details on how to use ASynK please refer to the included documentation, or the
official website for ASynK is at: http://karra-asynk.appspot.com You will find
links to latest download, complete documentaiton, and other information on
that website.

* About

  ASynK - Awesome Sync (by Karra), is a flexible PIM synchronization platform
  written in Python. ASynK was earlier known as Gout. High level features
  include:

  - ASynK allows two-way sync of Contacts across any two support sources -
    Google Contacts, Microsoft Outlook, and Emacs BBDB.
  
  - ASynK is the only two-way synchronization option for BBDB known to be in
    existence today. So if you are keen to keep your BBDB content synchronized
    with a mobile device or Outlook, look no further.
  
  - ASynK works on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux. Outlook synchronization
    only works on Windows.
  
  - Synchronization is granular to the level of 'Folders', i.e. you can
    synchronize one folder of Google Contacts with a Outlook folder (on
    Windows at work, say), and another Google folder in the same account with
    BBDB (On your Mac, say)
  
  - The infrastructure is there to add more database and item types
    (i.e. tasks, notes, etc.), but currently only Contacts synchronization for
    Google Contacts, BBDB and Outlook supported
    
  - It is free software, and released under the GNU AGPL (Affero GPL) version

* Installation

** Dependencies

   - You need Python (tested with 2.7, try earlier versions at your
     discretion; may not work with Python 3)

   - If you wish to sync to Outlook you can do that only on Windows. Further
     you will need MS Outlook installed, along with a third party python
     library called Pywin32 from Mark Hammond

   - On Debian (and likely Ubuntu) you will need the following packages:
        sudo apt-get install python-argparse
        
** Building Documentation

   There is no build or installation required to use the main program. You can
   go the section on Usage in the documentation

   If you wish to build the documentation from source, you can try one of the
   following: 

   - $ cd doc
   - $ make pdf
   - $ make 			# Builds all the targets
   - $ make clean
   - $ make distclean

   The supported doc types are: 'pdf', 'html', 'info', 'docbook', and 'text' 

   You may have to install additional programs like makeinfo, texi2html
   etc. See the "Dependencies" section in the documentation

** Usage

   The recommended way to use ASynK is to first create your own 'sync profile'
   which specifies which folders and PIM DBs you want to keep in sync. Refer
   to the documentation for more details.

   For the really impatient, ASynK comes with two default sync profiles that
   kick in if no other profile is configured.
   
   $ python asynk.py --op=sync [--dry-run] [--log=debug]

   If you run the above command on Windows, the entire default outlook
   contacts folder will get synched to "My Contacts" on Google Contacts. (You
   will be prompted for your google username and password). 

   On any non-windows platform your ~/.bbdb will be synced to google.

   For further usage help, try "python asynk.py -h"
